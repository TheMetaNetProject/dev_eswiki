|Description=A conceptual metaphor is a mapping between frames that arise from our embodied experiences.  The core of the conceptual network of metaphors are primary metaphors.  Though primary metaphors are thought to consist of experientially-based universals, it is the case that many conceptual metaphors are composed of relations between culturally-constrained semantic frames (e.g. ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP IS A JOURNEY).
