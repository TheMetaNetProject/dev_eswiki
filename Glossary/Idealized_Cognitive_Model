|Description=An ICM is a concept, or a cluster of related concepts, that defines our knowledge of a category.  An ICM is comprised of those features which most strongly characterize the category.  Members of a category who most strongly fit the definition imposed by the ICM are called prototypes.  For example, the ICM for the category bird includes an feathered animal, with two wings, that can fly, that has a beak and talons, and can lay eggs.  A prototypical bird would be something like a pigeon or sparrow, while a less prototypical bird would be something like a chicken or an ostrich.
