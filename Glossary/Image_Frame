|Description=Image schemas are prelinguistic representations of highly frametic patterns arising from imagistic domains of sensory-motor experience that recur in a variety of embodied domains (e.g. Container, Forces, Scale, Locomotion).  Image schemas, as embodied structures, have a psychological reality, are internally structured, and motivate conceptual metaphor mappings.
