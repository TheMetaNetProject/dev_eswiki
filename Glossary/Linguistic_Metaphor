|Description=A linguistic metaphor is an instantiation of, or linguistically mediated instance of, a more general conceptual metaphor.  Linguistic metaphors occur when words for source domain concepts are used for target domain concepts via metaphoric mappings.  Linguistic metaphors activate a conceptual metaphor, but they do not alter it.  (e.g. in the nominal clause "epidemic of poverty," the target domain concept Poverty is described using the source domain lexeme 'epidemic,' evoking the linguistic metaphor POVERTY IS AN EPIDEMIC. The use of the lexeme 'epidemic' evokes the more general Disease frame, which activates the more general conceptual metaphor POVERTY IS A DISEASE).
