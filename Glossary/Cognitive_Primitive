|Description=Cognitive primitives are simple conceptual building blocks formed experientially in infancy.  Cognitive primitives are often associated with image schemas in that they can be incorporated by image schemas.  However, cognitive primitives are unlike frames and image schemas in that they lack internal structure, and so cannot form gestalts.
(e.g. Causality, Containment, Animacy, Contact)
